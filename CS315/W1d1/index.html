<div><p>I’m Chadia Kayitesi and I’m original from Rwanda and I was living in North Carolina for one year
    and half. I’m flexible, humble and adaptative. I have been working as elecrical engineer for 3
    years. I’m only one child and being one child wasn’t easy for me, because my both parents passed
    away when I was kid. From the day my parents were passed away, my life has changed in different
    ways leaving in different families, change schools and so on. On day I went to live with my aunt
    who husband was director of Information Technology at University of Rwanda and he started to
    talk to me about Technology and how everything is changing in the world with Technology, it was
    so compelling hearing from him how technology is growing every day.</p>
    <p>when I moved to America and started doing some research about where I can learn programming,
        and got some friends who were graduated from MIU and then started talking about computer
        science and software development and how TM has helped them during their journey in MIU and
        how it helped them to find happiness, reduce stress how it was helped them to focus on program.
        And for my side I did my own research on MIU and recommend me and here I am. For me it is an
        opportunity to start career as software engineer and be a problem solver or innovate with it as I
        always dreamed to.
